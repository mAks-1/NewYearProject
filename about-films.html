        <h2>Harry Potter</h2>
        <p>
          The life of ten-year-old Harry Potter cannot be called sweet: his
          parents died as soon as he was one year old, and from his uncle and
          aunt who took the orphan into foster care, they only get jabs and
          cuffs. But on Harry's eleventh birthday, everything changes. A strange
          guest who unexpectedly appears on the doorstep brings a letter from
          which the boy learns that in fact he is a purebred wizard and accepted
          into Hogwarts - a school of magic. And in a couple of weeks, Harry
          will be racing on the Hogwarts Express train towards a new life, where
          incredible adventures, loyal friends and, most importantly, the key to
          unraveling the mystery of his parents' death await him.

        <h2>Home Alone</h2>
        <p>
          An American family leaves Chicago for Europe, but in a hurry to get
          ready, stupid parents forget at home ... one of their children. The
          young creature, however, is not lost and shows wonders of ingenuity.
          And when robbers enter the house, they have to regret meeting with a
          cute baby more than once.

        <h2>The Grinch</h2>
        <p>
          Anyone in the place of the Grinch would turn green and mad. As a
          decent introvert, he lives in a dark cave at the very top of the
          mountain away from everyone, but these “all” are preparing a grandiose
          celebration of the new year. They make noise, decorate everything and
          wildly enrage. Who would deny himself the pleasure of spoiling the
          holiday? The Grinch decides to steal the New Year.
